I was born and raised in a small town in Wisconsin. Now pursuing a associates degree in software programming. (full stack course.) I am 18 years old, just turned 19. Hoping one day to have a career in tech.

Currently a full time student @ Fox Valley. Attempting to complete my degree in 2 years. 

Goals: Travel the World. (haven't left USA.) Create a motivational program / app of sorts. (influenced towards teens and young adults struggling.) Finally, help my parents and fellow family long term.
